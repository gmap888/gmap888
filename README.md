# About Me
Hello, 👋🏽
I'm a dedicated Test Analyst, passionate about ensuring software quality and committed to continuous learning. With experience in Test Design, Web Testing, API Testing (Postman), SQL/Database, Agile SCRUM methodology, and Bug Tracking (JIRA), I apply a results-oriented approach to every project. I have knowledge of Javascript and Python, and currently, I am studying automation with Cypress.
