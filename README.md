## SOME OF MY BEST PROJECTS
#### Project 1: ProbaSorte(https://github.com/Hackathon-Luck-or-Misfortune/QA)

## Overview

This project was developed during a hackathon, with a focus on implementing robust Quality Assurance (QA) practices. As the QA lead, I played a pivotal role in ensuring the project's success through meticulous testing and strategic planning.

## Responsibilities

### 1. Mind Maps Creation
I developed comprehensive mind maps to visualize and plan various test scenarios. These mind maps served as a valuable guide throughout the testing process.

### 2. Test Case Development
Detailed test cases were created to cover a diverse range of conditions. This approach aimed to ensure comprehensive test coverage aligned with project requirements.

### 3. Test Execution
I executed tests with precision, identifying and thoroughly documenting any issues or discrepancies in the project's functionality.

### 4. BDD Test Writing
Adopting the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) methodology, I wrote tests that not only verified the system's functionality but also directly aligned with business requirements.

### 5. Requirements Creation
I contributed to the creation of clear and concise requirements, ensuring that all planned features were well-documented and thoroughly tested.

### 6. Interface/Functionality Testing
Rigorous testing of the interface and functionality was conducted to guarantee a seamless and error-free user experience.

## Achievements

The project emerged successfully from the hackathon, winning it demonstrating the effectiveness of the adopted QA approach. The collaborative effort between development and QA, coupled with the BDD methodology, resulted in a high-quality final product.
